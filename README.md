# tui
learning to make an editor; based on kilo

Create a folder with tui.c and Makefile.
To create a binary, type and enter `make` (as long as you have gcc installed on your terminal)

To create a new file, type `./tui:
- This will bring you to the homepage to where you can type in anything
- To save: `Ctrl-s` and a prompt will pop up to enter in the filename
- To quit: `Ctrl-q`
- If you quit without saving, a prompt will pop up. Press `Esc` to cancel or press `Ctrl-q` three more times to quit.

To open up an existing file, type `./tui [filename]`.
- All of the commands above still apply

*** This is a very rudimentary text editor in progress.
